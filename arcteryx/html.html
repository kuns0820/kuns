		<p>Durability and performance: from the beginning, Arc'teryx products have been guided by these two principles. As the rise of fast fashion increases the apparel industry’s social and environmental impacts, we continue striving to build durable gear that performs season after season.</p>
		<p>In addition to this obsessive focus on products that last, we also look at how our business affects the environment and our communities. As a collective of people who have chosen the outdoors as a way of life, environmental and social responsibility have long been close to our hearts. Effectively addressing these issues in our daily operations poses both a challenge and opportunity to meaningfully innovate.</p>
		<p>From the materials we choose, to where we build our products and the repair services we offer - all present opportunities to decide where we stand and to continually design better approaches. While we’d like to have perfect solutions, in many cases we are not there yet but we’re committed to the journey ahead. Our motivation is to design and build not only product, but also a company, that endures and performs over the long run.</p>

		<p>Our product philosophy is the foundation of our approach to sustainability. We believe that building products to last is the most powerful lever for minimizing our impact.</p>
		<p>We maximize performance and durability in a number of ways, including building products that perform for their intended use, and selecting proven materials that endure and wear well over time. Our timeless aesthetic remains contemporary, and we stand behind our lifetime care, repair and product guarantee.</p>

			<p>CLIMATE ACTION</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="text-box">
		<p>Climate change is an urgent issue with immediate impacts to communities and ecosystems around the world. The science tells us that we must cut global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero emissions around 2050 to limit warming to 1.5°C and prevent catastrophic and irreversible climate change. This will require global transformational change. Balancing climate impacts with business success is one of the biggest challenges that Arc’teryx currently faces. We are committing significant resources to addressing this challenge, with the same philosophy that we approach all parts of our business: guided by our values, informed by scientific research, and using design thinking to unlock meaningful solutions. Here you can learn about our approach to climate change, action we’re taking, and how we are engaged with industry partners and initiatives.</p>
		<p>We are in the process of developing emissions targets supported by climate science. While setting meaningful operational and value chain emission targets is a critical first step, this is only the preamble to the real action. Our goal is to build a sustainable low emissions mode of operations. To achieve this, we will make major efficiency gains in our supply chain, significantly reduce the impact of the materials that we use, and develop new, less carbon-intense business models. This is a major task, but a critical one for our business – and our industry. We believe the case is clear: acting and investing now to reduce impacts in the future is the right path forward for our business and for the planet.</p>
		<p>We are fortunate that we are not alone and our industry is taking significant action on climate. We are a signatory to the &nbsp;<a href="https://unfccc.int/climate-action/sectoral-engagement/global-climate-action-in-fashion/about-the-fashion-industry-charter-for-climate-action" target="_blank"> United Nations Fashion Climate Charter </a>&nbsp; and are collaborating alongside dozens of the world’s largest apparel and footwear brands. This charter marks an industry commitment to take measurable action, including cross-brand working groups to tackle the shared challenges within value chains of energy efficiency, renewables, coal substitution, freight and raw materials. This is an ambitious and promising effort by the UN which has brought a significant portion of the world’s apparel market to the table.</p>
		<p>In our backyard we have partnered with the &nbsp;<a href="https://blog.arcteryx.com/earth-day-pembina-institute/" target="_blank">Pembina Institute</a>&nbsp; who are a Canadian climate policy &amp; research think-tank to be one of the founding members of the &nbsp;<a href="https://www.pembina.org/BCCE" target="_blank">Business Coalition for a Clean Economy</a>&nbsp;, advocating for the political and business imperative to act ambitiously on climate change. We are also proud supporters of the Pembina Institute through our &nbsp;<a href="https://blog.arcteryx.com/do-right-days/" target="_blank">Do Right Days</a>&nbsp; which is where we support external projects and partners that align with our values.</p>
		<p>We are actively assessing alternative approaches to reduce our carbon footprint, and will continue to share updates on our climate targets and actions as they evolve.</p>

			<p>GLOBAL MANUFACTURING</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="text-box">
		<p>Arc'teryx has been intimately connected to manufacturing since our beginning. For many years our office and design floor was located inside our factory. Today we continue to expand our operations at our Vancouver manufacturing facility, ARC'One. This deep connection to manufacturing forms the basis of our approach to sustainability in our global supply chain.</p>
		<p>While Canadian production represents the foundation of our manufacturing knowledge, today our production is truly global. The volume of technical products we build far outstrips available production capacity in our region. Canada lacks the number of skilled technical apparel workers required to produce at our scale.</p>
		<p>To build product at the quality and volume we need, we partner with the highest performance technical apparel factories in 9 countries. We stand behind every product we make, regardless of where it is built. An Arc'teryx label means that product meets quality standards and embodies the same values of durability and performance.</p>
